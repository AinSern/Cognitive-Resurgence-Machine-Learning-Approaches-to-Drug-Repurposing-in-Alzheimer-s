 Cognitive Resurgence: Machine Learning in Alzheimer's Drug Repurposing uses machine learning to identify existing drugs for Alzheimer's treatment. By analyzing molecular and clinical data, it predicts potential drug-disease interactions, offering a faster, cost-effective path to discovering new treatments for Alzheimer's.
To tackle the complex challenge of drug repurposing, I utilized a multi-step approach involving data acquisition, preprocessing, feature engineering, and model selection. My process included:

Data Acquisition: I sourced data from multiple biomedical databases, including PubChem, DrugBank, and OMIM. This dataset included thousands of compounds with detailed features such as molecular structures, protein targets, and known interactions with disease-related biomarkers. I combined this information with biological activity data and disease ontologies to create a comprehensive dataset for training and evaluation.

Feature Engineering and Dimensionality Reduction: Given the high dimensionality of the data, I employed feature engineering techniques to create meaningful features, such as molecular descriptors (e.g., molecular weight, polarity) and chemical fingerprints. To reduce feature complexity, I used Principal Component Analysis (PCA), which helped in retaining the most informative features while minimizing noise and redundant information.

Model Selection and Implementation: I experimented with multiple supervised machine learning techniques to find the most effective models for predicting potential drug-disease interactions:

Logistic Regression: Used as a baseline model to understand the data distribution and relationships among basic features.
Support Vector Machines (SVM): Utilized to maximize margin and distinguish complex, non-linear drug-disease relationships by applying a kernel trick, particularly effective for high-dimensional data.
Random Forests: Chosen for its robustness in handling imbalanced data and its ability to provide feature importance rankings, which allowed me to interpret which molecular and biological features were most influential in predicting drug-disease interactions.
Neural Networks: Designed with multiple hidden layers to capture deeper patterns within the dataset, especially complex, non-linear interactions that may not be captured by simpler models.
Training and Hyperparameter Tuning: For each model, I conducted extensive hyperparameter tuning to optimize accuracy. This involved methods such as Grid Search and Randomized Search CV, ensuring each model's parameters were tailored to maximize performance.

Model Evaluation and Validation: I evaluated each model using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. In addition to cross-validation, I used bootstrapping methods to obtain more robust performance estimates. This step helped identify overfitting and underfitting issues, especially in the neural network model, which I adjusted with dropout layers and regularization techniques to prevent overfitting.

Interpretability and Feature Importance: To ensure the results were interpretable, especially for drug discovery stakeholders, I leveraged SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) values to provide feature importance scores in neural networks and random forests. This allowed me to highlight which chemical and biological properties were consistently influential across models in predicting drug-disease pairs.
